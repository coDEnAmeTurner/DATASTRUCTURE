- Write bfsPrint for undirected adjacency matrix:
  + How do i get the neighbours:
    - get the neighbours by matrix[front]
    - now what if the neighbour leads back to the already visited vertex? Then, it skipped.
    - now that vector subscript fuck + source file is different from the module
      After cleaning the prev build (lclick project + Clean), and rebuild, things work.
