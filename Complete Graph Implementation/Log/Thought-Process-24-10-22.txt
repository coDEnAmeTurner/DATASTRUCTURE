Write kruskal() for adjacencyList
- Do we even need adjacencyList[i][j].cost > 0 when finding smallest cost edge?
  Why if we have an edge with weight 0 from matrix one? No, weight can't be zero, 
  weight is to judge the cost of something, the cost can't be 0.
- edge.to is not an index of edge.begin, its another edge.begin...
Write prim():
- Why have to translate undirected to 2 directed? Since we need to find the neighbour, if we keep it as undirected, the neighbour can be either end, which is a big fuss
- But we have edge in edgelist as 1 edge per undirected edge. So the begin or end can be either side.
- How do I know what edge.to is when the edge is undirected????
