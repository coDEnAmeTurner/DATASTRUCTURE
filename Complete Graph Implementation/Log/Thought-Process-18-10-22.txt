Write bellford for edgelistgraph:
- INT_MAX + 5 becomes something a little greater than INT_MIN, which is not our intention...
- Bellford doesn't detect all nodes caught in negative cycle:
  Because my code check if the dist[begin] is INT_MIN before checking the dist[begin] + edge.cost < dist[end]
  So it skips what's supposed to be definitely smaller than dist[end].
Write bellford for adjacency matrix:
- vector subscript out of range after traversing the matrix
