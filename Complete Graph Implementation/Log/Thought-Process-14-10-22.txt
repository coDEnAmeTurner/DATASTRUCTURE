Write indexed_priority_queue class
  Am I developing indexed priority queue for only graph implementation or general use?
  Only graph implem
  + vals, pm, im will be dynamic array with smart pointer, put in private, size of vertex list
    Each vals index is vertex Index
  + What method should we start at?
    Depend on what you use first? 
      Function only does the job its name tends for
    - Write contains(int ki)
    - Write insert(int ki, int value)
    - Write swim(int im's index)
