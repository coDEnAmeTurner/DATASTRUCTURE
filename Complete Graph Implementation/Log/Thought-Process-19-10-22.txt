Write Union Find
- First of all, how to implement array id of vertices?
  It is to use mapping? Mapping what to what? 
  - Map vertex index to array index... What if having vertex index as array index
    which means union find array has the size of vertex list
  - There's no add vertex operation for union find, there are only unify or find.
    So the assumption is that the array of vertices is given beforehand.
    This means at the first place of having a union find ds, we already have 
    that array of vertices, all initialized as itself.
- have an array sz of component's size, with each component associated with an index.
  Ex: sz[5], meaning size of component with root as vertex 5.
- do i need a field to save the size of 2 arrays? yes
- stop at writing the connected method to check if 2 vertices in the same component.
- write componentSize() method
