Write indexed_priority_queue class supporting eager dijkstra:
- what is key? vertex index: a number. vertex index is not the PQ node index.
  + How to hash a key to a key index (hash value)? Bidrectional mapping, how to implement
    this mapping? We need a hash table!
    - How large is this hash table? More like: how many keys do you want to store? 
      It is number of vertices so size: 1.3 times larger than number of vertices.
    - What hash function is used?
- what is value? distance
